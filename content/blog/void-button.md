Inspired by some recent postings around the web showcasing [GeoCities-style 88x31 pixel GIF buttons](https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/),
including some buttons for various Linux and BSD distributions,
I decided to try my hand at creating one for [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org), which missed the Golden Age of these buttons.

Here's what I came up with:

![a grey, rectangular button with the words "Powered by VOID" and the void logo, which has an animated shine effect every 5 seconds](/blog/void-button/void-button-anim.gif)

I created the button at 4x scale (352x124) so that there could be more detail seen if desired.

I started out with the [Void logo](https://repo-default.voidlinux.org/logos/):

![the Void Linux logo, a two-tone green ring with a large gap between each half and a dot in the centre. Above it is the text VOID.](https://repo-default.voidlinux.org/logos/void.svg)

Separating the text and adding a black border for contrast in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/),
I imported the SVGs into [Krita](https://krita.org/) and created the button shape as a background.
When adding the "Powered by" text, I chose [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans)
because it is easily readable at the target size and it has a friendly licence (the Open Font Licence).

I wanted to add a small animated element to this button, and this project also gave me a chance to try out Krita's animation functions.
I was *very* impressed with the curves animation tools.
It allowed me to control the exact position of the animated overlay as it moved along its path, including the speed, which gave a very nice result.
Here it is at full size:
