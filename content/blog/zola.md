From the start, I've wanted to keep this website as simple as possible.

<!-- more -->

It started as just a static HTML file, totalling around 100 lines (including styles), listing some of my projects and contact info.
I wanted to make it more than that and share some of my thoughts and write more about some projects,
but I didn't want to go through the effort of making it look good while melding it with the complexity of a CMS (like WordPress) or deal with the idiosyncracies of a static site generator (I've used SSGs like Jekyll and looked at others, like Hugo, in the past).
However, I found [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) recently and found it to be simple, yet flexible enough for what I needed.
So far the Zola experience has been pretty nice and smooth, and I hope it continues that way.
